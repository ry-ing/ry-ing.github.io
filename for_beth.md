# For Beth

I was struggling to come up with ideas for your birthday that you would want, but also didn't cost a lot of money.  I thought it might be useful if I offer you a "**1 Year Dissertation Help Voucher**" to provide you with unlimited help with all dissertation realted tasks, as I like to think this is something I know quite a bit about and I am interested in.

This includes:
- Help with setting up and writing in LaTeX using Overleaf (if you choose to use it)
- Any coding help if you choose to use it (e.g. python, R for any stats you need)
- How to use a reference manager and keep track of your papers (Zotero)
- Tips on how to go about writing up your dissertation
- Unlimited proof reads. (I know I'm not that good at english, but I'm quite good at science writing and seeing whats missing/ if theres too much)

## Referencing

One of the first things that is helpful to master is referencing which includes the reading, sorting, organizing and logging of all the relevant papers in the field you are doing research in. It is definetely helpful to start your project with a literature review, as it enables you to understand where your project fits into existing research. It also helps you to connect recurring ideas/concepts from multiple papers, getting an idea of the problems they are trying to solve and what direction/ goal they are trying to head towards. Below is some of the tools I use to help with this:

#### Conneted Papers
(https://www.connectedpapers.com). Connected papers allows you to search for a paper and visualize where it fits in, and how it is related to all other relevant publications. This allows you to see when/where methods and ideas were first concieved and where the research is flowing towards. Its also great if you have a key paper that your project is based around; as it will list relevant papers that you should probably also read. c
