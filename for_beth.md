# For Beth

I was struggling to come up with ideas for your birthday that you would want, but also didn't cost a lot of money.  I thought it might be useful if I offer you a "**1 Year Dissertation Help Voucher**" to provide you with unlimited help with all dissertation realted tasks, as I like to think this is something I know quite a bit about and I am interested in.

This includes:
- Help with setting up and writing in LaTeX using Overleaf (if you choose to use it)
- Any coding help if you choose to use it (e.g. python, R for any stats you need)
- How to use a reference manager and keep track of your papers (Zotero)
- Tips on how to go about writing up your dissertation
- Unlimited proof reads. (I know I'm not that good at english, but I'm quite good at science writing and seeing whats missing/ if theres too much)

## Referencing

One of the first things that is helpful to master is referencing which includes the reading, sorting, organizing and logging of all the relevant papers in the field you are doing research in. It is definetely helpful to start your project with a literature review, as it enables you to understand where your project fits into existing research. It also helps you to connect recurring ideas/concepts from multiple papers, getting an idea of the problems they are trying to solve and what direction/ goal they are trying to head towards. Below is some of the tools I use to help with this:

#### Conneted Papers
(https://www.connectedpapers.com). Connected papers allows you to search for a paper and visualize where it fits in, and how it is related to all other relevant publications. This allows you to see when/where methods and ideas were first concieved and where the research is flowing towards. Its also great if you have a key paper that your project is based around; as it will list relevant papers that you should probably also read. 

#### Lateral
(https://www.lateral.io/product/use-cases). I haven't actually used this website yet, but I'm planning to when I start my PhD. It uses AI to connect text from a bunch of different documents. This allows you to digest papers a lot better, gather the main concets from multiple paper and organize your views on them. Only the first 500 pages are free, but might be useful to start your literature review with. I wouldnt recommend using it as a reference manager though. 

#### Zotero (reference manager)
With all the papers you are reading it is smart to use a dedicated tool to organize them, store them and create a biblography from them. For this I use Zotero. There are many others (mendeley, endnote, etc) but this is the one I use, its free, easy to use and I like it. You will first need to download the Zotero desktop application from (https://www.zotero.org). It is also helpful to install the google chrome extension. After that when you are reading a paper online, all you need to do is click the "Add to library" button on the google chrome extension and the PDF of the paper, all the metadata and its citation will all be saved automatically to your library. From here you can organize your library, read and make notes on the paper and easily export your entire biblography automatically to Overleaf. Additionally if a paper gets retracted, Zotero will let you know. I'll show you how to add your biblography to Overleaf. 

*I've also heard people like using paperpile (https://paperpile.com/features/reference-manager/). This also looks pretty good, but I havent used it yet.*
