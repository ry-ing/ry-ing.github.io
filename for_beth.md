# For Beth

I was struggling to come up with ideas for your birthday that you would want, but also didn't cost a lot of money.  I thought it might be useful if I offer you a "**1 Year Dissertation Help Voucher**" to provide you with unlimited help with all dissertation realted tasks, as I like to think this is something I know quite a bit about and I am interested in.

This includes:
- Help with setting up and writing in LaTeX using Overleaf
- Any coding help if you choose to use it (e.g. python, R for any stats you need)
- How to use a reference manager and keep track of your papers (Zotero)
- Tips on how to go about writing up your dissertation
- Unlimited proof reads. (I know I'm not that good at english, but I'm quite good at science writing and seeing whats missing/ if theres too much)
